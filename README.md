# BookStore

## Description

This project implements the graphical interface of a book store, where the customers can check the catalog and add the avaliable books to their shopping cart. After finishing the selection process, they can press the checkout option in order to do the corresponding payment.

The collection of books is stored in an XML file. Jframe, a Swing class, is used to build the graphical interface and let the user interact with the several objects.
